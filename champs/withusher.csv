"1989","All You Had To Do Was Stay","This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this_I wish you knew that_Do you like it!?_It's 2 am, in your car_Windows down, past my street the memories start_It's in the past_You drive straight ahead_You thinking that I hate you now_Cause you still don't know what I never said_I wish you would come back_Wish I never hung up the phone like I did_People like you always want back_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_The love they gave away_All you had to do was stay_Here you are now, calling me up_But I don't know what to say_I've been picking up the pieces_Of the mess you made_People like you always want back_The love they pushed aside_But people like me are gone forever_When you say goodbye_(Stay!) Hey_And people like me wanna believe you_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)_When you say you've changed_Let me remind you_This was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)_You ended it_You were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)_But not like this_Not like this_Not like this_Oh, all you had to do was_(Stay!) Hey_All you had to do was stay_The more I think about it now_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was_(Stay!) Hey_All you had to do was stay_Had me in the palm of your hand_Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?(Stay!) Hey_The less I know_Now, you say you want it back_Now that it's just too late_(All you had to do was stay)_Well, could've been easy_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!) (Oh)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All you had to do was (stay!) (Ooh)_All you had to do was (stay!)_All I know is that you drove us_Off the road_(Stay!) Hey","Taylor Swift"

"1989","Out Of The Woods","So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together_And you come and sing and listen_I would not think about it but I'm not done_Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I_Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes_And guns_They are the hunters we are the foxes_And we run_Baby, I know places we won't be found_And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down_Cause I, I know places we can hide_I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:_I know places, I know places_Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places_Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing_Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i_Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i_Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i_Na na na na waiting at the back door_They're around and the vultures come around_And you know that they won't, they won't us_Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us_Looking at it now_Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?_Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?_Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?_Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?_We were lying on your couch_Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (Out of the woods)_Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?_Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good_Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?_Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?_Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?_Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good(Are we out of the woods?)_Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?_Twenty stitches in a hospital room_When you started crying, baby, I did too_I remember_But when the sun came up, I was looking at you_Remember when we couldn't take the heat?_I walked out and said, ""I'm setting you free""But the monsters turned out to be just trees_When the sun came up, you were looking at me_You were looking at me, ooh_You were looking at me_(Are we out of the woods yet?

"1989","Shake It Off","So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song.

Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that._Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah._You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out._And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track, that's the good weed._You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it._Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha._But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good_Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um..._Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!_But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha._You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him._Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!_But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good_Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood_Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood_Uh, what's understood ain't gotta be explained_But you don't understand me, so let me explain_Stood in the heat, the flame","Lil Wayne"

"Thrill of the Arts","Guided Smile Meditation","You might listen to this in headphones in a lossless format._This tambrel meditation technique was pioneered by a man named Don Wasserman, and I had the honor to learn directly from Don.  He would use acoustic sounds to guide the sensation of the meditation.  I have expanded to the synthesizer, so I'll be at my keyboard to help guide these sensations._Let's start with the face.  This is a very busy part of our body.  This is mission control.  A lot of senses meet at this nexus, and there's quite a bit of activity.  There's a constant chatter in this region, constant computation, and it's very loud.  But you may not notice it, like a refrigerator that's running and suddenly shuts off._That quiet chatter is constantly happening.  And it's good.  This is how we decide, how we go about our day.  But it is important to have some control over this chatter.  For example, let's gently roll some of the high end off this chatter.  It's important to examine this chatter.  These are your thoughts.  They say the unexamined life is not worth living.  Well the unexamined thoughts, it's not worth thinking._You might move these thoughts forward from behind your eyes and mind, just a few feet in front of you, and just, just look at them.  See what, see what they're up to.  See what they're saying.  After all, they're your thoughts.  You might notice the thoughts gently orbiting around your head.  Until they're a few feet in back of your head and they gently fade away, this chatter.  And you're left just experiencing what is currently happening._I like to think of a dog meditating.  A deep inhale.  Release.  Sense a smile spreading through the eyes._And with a gentle listening and receptivity, aware of the ass.  This is a chance to check in.  I studied with a great teacher who would refer to this as the ""ha-ha region"".  Listening to and feeling whatever mood is here, without judgement, an honest contact.  Much like the chatter, we're unaware of our ass most of the day.  You might add in an ambience around your ass.  Experience this new space.  Feel this new sense of freedom to exist with, with ya ass.","Vulfpeck"

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth_Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with_So won't you raise your glass won't you_So won't you raise your glass won't you_So won't you raise your glass won't you_So won't you raise your glass won't you_And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""_No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""_I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer_And I am(Here's to the Roc)_I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a Techno_Marine, that's what we wore back then_I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""_And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""_And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said_""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""_And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to..._...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up..._...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX_And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""_And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)_""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""_You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""_That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man..._I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up_Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad_Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""_Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow_I got 11 plaques on my walls right now_You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""_""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""","Kanye West"
