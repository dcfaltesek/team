And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that._Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah._You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out._And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track, that's the good weed._You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it._Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha._But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good_Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um..._Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!_But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha._You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him._Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!_But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good_Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood_Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood_Uh, what's understood ain't gotta be explained_But you don't understand me, so let me explain_Stood in the heat, the flame"
